    <h2>Chapter One: The Mud</h2>
    <p>
      I didn’t wake up one day and decide to rebuild my life.<br>
      Life decided for me.<br><br>

      I was buried before I bloomed. The mud was thick — not just the mud of poverty, of struggle, of pain, but the kind that clings to your name and won’t wash off. Mistakes, regret, stigma, loneliness... I had them all. And for a long time, I believed that was all I would ever be.<br><br>

      There were days when I had nothing. Not even hope. But deep beneath the surface, something stirred — not loudly, not beautifully, but stubbornly. It was a whisper that said, <em>"You are not done yet."</em><br><br>

      That whisper became a spark. That spark became a plan. That plan is this project. This is the beginning of rising from the mud.
