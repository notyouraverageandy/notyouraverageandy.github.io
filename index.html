    <h1>Never Forget, You Are Amazing, And You Are Loved</h1>
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Andrew's Photo" />

    <p>My name is Andrew, and for most of my life, people have said I was just “dealt a bad deck of cards.”</p>
    <p>My earliest memories aren’t of toys or cartoons — they’re of drugs, violence, and chaos. I was raised in a world of addiction, abuse, and survival. My mother struggled with meth, cocaine, and alcohol. My father battled alcoholism. I saw things no child should ever witness. I lived through years of pain, abandonment, and trauma — but I survived.</p>

    <p>At 12, I was already lost in the same cycle — using meth, drinking, and searching for something that felt like safety. I dropped out of school. I was taken advantage of. I had a child while I was still a child myself. I spent years trying to escape what I was born into, but I never had a real chance to build something better.</p>

    <p>Now, I want to try — really try. And I need your help.</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>My mission is to share my story with others, to help build them up in times of high stress — especially when they've experienced the unthinkable. I want people to know that they can achieve anything they put effort into. If they hold on to faith and love, they can continue on — even in a world that didn’t prepare them to survive.</p>

    <p>I believe that love conquers all hardship. That there is still hope in this world. And that there are still good people out there — people like you — who care enough to help.</p>

    <h2>Why I'm Asking for $1</h2>
    <p>I’m not asking for a handout. I’m asking for one dollar — from anyone willing to help give me a real shot at life. Just one dollar can help me create stability, support my children, care for my mother, and finally move forward. If a million people gave $1, it would change everything.</p>
